## About

This folder contains my solution for the pre-assignment. The assignment is solved by
using JavaScript with React and Express. These are the main files you should be interested of:

### `convertStatusToJSON.js`

We will convert the status.real file into JSON with the function in this file. Can be found on the root folder.

### `Packages.js`

Listing of the Packages is done on this file. Can be found on "client/src/components/package".
