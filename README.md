## About

This folder contains my solution for the pre-assignment. The assignment is solved by
using JavaScript with React and Express. This project is deployed on: https://reaktorpreassignmentsolution.herokuapp.com/. These are the main files you should be interested of:

### `convertStatusToJSON.js`

### `Packages.js`

Listing of the Packages is done on this file. Can be found in "/client/src/components/package".

### `PackageInfo.js`

Information of each package is displayed with this component. Can be found in "/client/src/components/package".

### `server.js`

Sends the JSON formatted data we parsed from "status.real" to the React client. Can be found in the root folder.
